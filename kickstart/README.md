Requirements:
You need a network connection to pull the disk image and install packages.

We allocate 3/4 of your system memory and the full count of cpus to the VM, check if you're happy with those properties.

We allocate a 200G disk lazily. You do not need that much space up front.

The disk lives in the ./disk directory which will be created here,
but is a degree of freedom for you to mount another disk if you want.
